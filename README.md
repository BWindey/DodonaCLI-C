# DodonaCLI in C 
As a challenge for myself, and to learn the language, I decided to try rewrite as much as possible from the original DodonaCLI (https://github.com/BWindey/DodonaCLI), 
written by me in Python, in the C programming language.

If you stumbled upon this, and want to actively use this, please go towards the original: https://github.com/BWindey/DodonaCLI

As long as this version isn't somewhat feature-complete, I'll never recommend it.


## To Do:
[ ] All the subcommands without functionality (so parse command-line args)
[ ] Implement subcommands that don't make an API-request
[ ] Implement https requests
[ ] Implement json (use library?)
[ ] Create some abstraction layer around API (maybe some level of caching)
[ ] Implement subcommands who rely on the API
[ ] Create some library for displaying rich text (colours, bold, italic, ...)
